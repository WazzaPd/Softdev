QCC:

- The animation is achieved using the requestAnimationFrame() method, which 
calls the step() function repeatedly to update the animation.

- The step() function calculates the elapsed time since the animation 
started using the timestamp argument and schedules the next call to step() 
using requestAnimationFrame().

- The animation is paced using a setTimeout() method with a 50ms delay, which 
causes the drawDot() function to be called again after 50ms.

- The animation can be stopped using the cancelAnimationFrame() and 
clearTimeout() methods, which are called from the stopIt() function when the 
stop button is clicked.

Disco:

- setTimeout() is used to schedule a function to be executed after a specified 
delay.

- clearTimeout() is used to cancel a previously scheduled timeout.

- The requestAnimationFrame() method is used to create smooth and efficient 
animations in JavaScript.

- Variables are used to store and update the state of the animation, such as 
the current radius of the circle and whether it is growing or shrinking.

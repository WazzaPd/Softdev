===================================================================
QCC:
1. predict: We will have a table of names and be able to click them
1. observe: We have a table of names. Click on one and get an alert. contents of alert = name you clicked on

2. td = individual names. tr = table row. table = whole table. click and get alert. click on tr get row of names. click table get entire table of names
2. click on name, get name, then row with raw html, then table with raw html as alerts.

3. //Q: What will happen when next line is uncommented?
   //e.stopPropagation();
   Predict: The alert will no longer pop up. Stops the flow of events
   Observe: individual and row did not pop up, only table

   //Q: What effect does the boolean arg have?
   //table.addEventListener('click', clicky, false);
   Predict: The table alert will no longer pop up. The true was allowing it to bypass stopPropagation()
   Observe: Table no longer pops up. Individual name pops up.

   comment: stopPropagation stops the event from propagating any more than the current. True causes events to be triggered during capture phase

   // Q: When user clicks on a cell, in what order will the pop-ups appear?
   if table event is true:
      - Table
      - Tr
      - Td
   else:
      - Td
      - Tr
      - Table

4. //Q: Does the order in which the event listeners are attached matter?
   //A: No it doesn't matter

   //Q: What effect does the boolean arg have in each?
   //   (Leave exactly 1 version uncommented to test...)
   A: the True causes the event to trigger in the capture phase and the false casuses the event to trigger in the bubble phase.

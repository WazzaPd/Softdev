K30 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2023-04-25

===================================================================
DISCO:
- Callbacks work like recursive calls. They keep the animation going after each call of drawDot and .
- drawimage resizes the image to fit within the x and y parameters

QCC:
- Are there different type of events? Cause why does code no work even when event is plugged into the parameter?
